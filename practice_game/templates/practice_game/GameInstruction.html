        Practice Game Instruction
    </h3>
        <p>Hello! This is the <strong>5-round practice game</strong>.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            At the beginning of each game, you will be randomly assigned an initial opinion and then in the following rounds, you will
            (1) observe two other subjects <u>randomly</u> and decide whether to connect (or reconsider whether to keep the connection if they are already in your network) with them;
            (2) keep updating your opinion based on your opinion and your neighbors' opinions in previous rounds. <br>
            The goal of the game is to <strong>find agreements among all subjects</strong>. So you need to connect with subjects who have similar opinions. <br>
            In practice game, you will have <b style="color:blue;">20 seconds</b> to choose neighbors and <b style="color:blue;">30 seconds</b> to update opinion each round.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your payoff in round \( t \) is as follows:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                If you have neighbor(s), your payoff this round is: <br>
                <strong>Payoff this round = sum of payoffs with all neighbors \( * 10000 \)</strong> <br>
            And specifically, the payoff with one neighbor is:<br>
<strong>Payoff with neighbor \(k \) = \( \color{red}{0.025} \) - \( \color{red}{0.2} \) \( * \) (your opinion in \( t \)  round - neighbor \( k \)'s opinion in \( t-1 \)  round)\( ^2 \) - \( \color{red}{0.8} \) \( * \)(your opinion in \( t \)  round - your opinion in \( t-1 \)  round)\( ^2 \)</strong><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you donâ€™t have neighbor, your payoff this round is:<br>
	<strong>Payoff this round = - (your opinion in \( t \)  round - your opinion in \( t-1  \) round)\( ^2 * 10000 \)</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
